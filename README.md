# 🧠 CASKKet — The Brainrot Decoder

CASKKet is a web app that bridges the growing communication gap between generations. As Gen Z slang (a.k.a. brainrot) becomes more chaotic and widespread online, older generations often struggle to understand what’s being said. CASKKet solves this by decoding brainrot—spoken or written—into clear, proper English.

🚀 Features

🎙️ Speech input — Speak brainrot directly into your mic, and CASKKet will transcribe and translate it in real time.

💬 Text translation — Type slang-filled phrases to instantly see their formal English equivalents.

🧩 Context-aware decoding — Converts not just words but phrases, memes, and tone for more accurate translations.

🧠 Expandable slang dictionary — Continuously updated with the latest internet lingo, memes, and cultural references.

🌐 Simple, modern interface — Built to be intuitive for users of all ages.

💡 Purpose

Language evolves fast—especially online. What sounds normal to one generation can be incomprehensible to another. CASKKet helps close that gap, fostering better communication between digital-native youth and older audiences (parents, teachers, employers, etc.) through humor and technology.
